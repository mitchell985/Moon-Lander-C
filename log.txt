1.38pm-4.00pm
working on letting the program read a key from a key press.
it don't work thier is a way that to got the keypress to input but it blanks out the screen to do so,
using ncurses, thier is another way that im yet to try using the terminals own key detection by looking at the terminals
struct but its long, though i beleive i could make it shorter ncurses appears more appelling as its a lib build for making games,
through i could learn SDL because its installed on imageworld maybe... ? ncurses stays in the terminal and may work over ssh ??

looking it old if you what to see what i did with acsii esc codes.

9.00pm-11.00pm
making a makefile to work with ncurses and learning how to use it.
started playing with ncurses and making some examples.

12.00pm-3.00pm
making more examples and replicating what i did with esc codes then expanding it to read keys.
so i got the menu to work and the keypress if you select exit it close, which is good, i think i need,
to plan how the game is going to work. as i now have an idea of how ncurses works
