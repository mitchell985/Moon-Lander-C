Colours colour everything and as a freind said ill try choose colours that colour bind people can see


Algorithms:

Ones that i come up with ??


User Interface:

The Main Menu needs the title at the top followed by the instructions for the game
I'll attempt to make the instuctions funny or witty...
At the Bottom there's the menu system controlled by the up and down arrow and the enter 
key
In the Game it self i what in the corner the stats of what the ship is doing, the ship
well start in the centre of the screen, (a nice ascii ship) and start falling as soon
as the game starts, due to the gravity. i what left, right and up control so ill need
the 'asd' keys as for the surface like previously said randomly generated
