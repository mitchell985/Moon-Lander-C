Unique ID: Clear bug

thier was a problem that if you typed clear in to the terminal then ran the program the backround colour would not be changed for the size of the screen -2
so i made it move down the screen the size of y -2 then draw the background.
another other way of fixing this bug could to move the cursour to the top of the terminal then use my clear screen fuction to clear the whole screen.

Unique ID: Screen Flashing

the screens flashs repeatly.
from what steffan said it could have something to do with the fact that the pi's CLI does not have a v-sync.
am going to run startx and see how the game runs, yes it well in the GUI on the pi. but the response time on
the keypresses is slow, going to try decrease the DELAY. 
changed the clear that clear the whole screen to refresh which lets you refresh what needs to be drawen
the only problem is the debug information is not cleared and redrawen but ill comment out the debug information when i finish

Status: Fixed


Unique ID: Keys Buffering

so the keys are having problems being dected.
if you slowdown the DELAY and press a key it stores a whole lot in the buffer and takes along time to catch up, not less thats what i think is happening
the DELAY time has be decreased so that it can check keypresses more offten

Unique ID: The Clear Thruster

the code used to clear a thruster is clear a part of the surface.
i could make a window over the top of the surface that says you've win or you lost over the problem
cleared the screen before the user can see anything

Unique ID: Win Lost Any Key Input

the problem is the keypress staying in the buffer from playing the game and being read by the win lost codes getch
the easy solution would be to use a getch before its needed to reset the buffer back to -1.
went for the easy solution
